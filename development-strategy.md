# biggest & smallest: development strategy

Building this site one step at a time

## 0. Setup

(already complete)

## 1. Data & Log

(already complete)

## 2. Init

> - which files of code do you need to change?
>   In handlers file reset.js and save-number.js.
>   Also I changed listeners folder.
> - what are you changing in them?
>   In save-number.js file I use 'Math.max and Math.min' functions to find smallest and biggest values.
>   In listeners folder I add an event to activate save-button and reset button.

## 3. User Story: \_\_\_

> - which user story makes sense to code first?
>   I take the input value and change it to Number. Then I gave names to values as numbers.current, smallest and biggest. I wrote function. At the end Ire=render the saved values.
> - what are you changing in them?
>   In listeners.save-number.js I take the button with getElementById to add click event. Then I added it to the save-handler function.

## 4. User Story: \_\_\_

> - which user story makes sense to code first?
>   For users to re-begin I prepared reset button. When they click reset button they can begin the operation with a new sitatus.
> - which files of code do you need to change?
>   In handlers.reset file I have written a function for reset button to start page as a new.
> - what are you changing in them?
>   In listeners.reset.js I take the button with getElementById to add click event.
